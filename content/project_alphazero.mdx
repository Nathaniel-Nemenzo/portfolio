# Introduction

## Background
This project is an implementation of AlphaZero algorithm for two-player adversarial games. The goal is to develop an AI agent that can learn and play a variety of games at a high level without any prior knowledge or human intervention.

## Objectives
The main objectives of the project are to:
- Implement AlphaZero algorithm for two-player adversarial games
- Train an AI agent that can play a variety of games at a high level
- Evaluate the performance of the AI agent against existing AI agents

# Methodology

## Approach
The implementation is based on self-play and Monte Carlo Tree Search methods from AlphaZero. The agent plays against itself and learns from its own mistakes, gradually improving its gameplay strategy over time. The Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm is used to efficiently explore the game tree and select the best move based on the current state of the game.

## Tools
The implementation is written in Python and uses PyTorch for deep learning and Ray for distributed computing. The code is available on GitHub at [https://github.com/Nathaniel-Nemenzo/alphazero](https://github.com/Nathaniel-Nemenzo/alphazero).

# Results

## Evaluation
The agent is tested on several games, including Chess, Go, and Shogi. The agent is able to learn and play at a high level, achieving performance comparable to or better than existing AI agents.

## Analysis
The results are presented in detail in the accompanying paper, along with an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the implementation and suggestions for future research.

# Conclusion

## Contributions
The implementation demonstrates the effectiveness of AlphaZero algorithm for two-player adversarial games. The agent is able to learn and play a variety of games at a high level without any prior knowledge or human intervention.

## Future Work
The code is open source and can be used as a basis for further research in this area. Future work could focus on improving the performance of the agent, expanding the range of games it can play, and exploring different variations of the AlphaZero algorithm.
